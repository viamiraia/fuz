<h1 align='center'>fuz</h1>

**fuz** is a library for probability fusion, allowing the merging of distribution functions in a principled manner.

with **fuz**, you can do things like bayesian evidence updating, optimal bayesian ranking, and fuzzy logic.

## highlights

- pooling
  - linear, multiplicative, geometric, holder ...etc.
- fuzzy logic extension to distribution functions
- numerical integration in logarithmic space for stability
- `NaN` and logarithmic complex number handling
- distribution tools

## upcoming features

- wider compatibility with `narwhals`
  - dataframes, functions, samples ...etc.
- initial gpu support with `jax`

## other

the official pronunciation of **fuz** is a fugued function of fuzzy fusion ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸ˜¿ please help ðŸ˜½

contributions are extremely welcome! i'm especially looking for:

- co-maintainers
- development help
- mathematician/computer scientist help
- real-world feedback
- potential help with an academic paper, if this qualifies

between life, work, and wayyy too many hobbies, research directions, and passion projects, i am always really short on time. also, i'm honestly not that good at math and cs, and there's definitely ways to improve that i haven't thought of. any possible help is sincerely appreciated. this is also my first publicly published python packageðŸ˜¸, so please let me know if there's anything i can do differently.

you can also support my original research by donating at [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/viamiraia) and/or following me @viamiraia on most social media (@raia.fun on bluesky)
