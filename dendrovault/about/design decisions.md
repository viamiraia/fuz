i've been dilly-dallying on this project for over 5 years now. i made the python notebooks a long time ago, but with my audhd i was just stuck on creating the web app. with the advent of a few useful plugins, i figured i could get a working poc out faster with obsidian.

## principles

- keep it as simple as possible. 
	- minimal external plugins.

## plugins used
